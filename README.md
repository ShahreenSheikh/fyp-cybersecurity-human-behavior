Final Year Project on Synergizing Human Behavior and Cybersecurity
Synergizing Human Behavior and Cybersecurity using Psychometric Behavioral Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on bridging the gap between human behavior and cybersecurity. While cybersecurity technologies have advanced significantly, human error remains one of the primary vulnerabilities in digital security systems. The project integrates behavioral psychology with cybersecurity to develop adaptive, user-centered strategies that enhance threat detection and prevention.

Project Objectives
Analyze and integrate human behavioral patterns into cybersecurity frameworks to improve threat detection and prevention.

Develop psychometric profiles and behavioral personas to design personalized cybersecurity training.

Enhance cybersecurity culture through leadership involvement and feedback systems.

Promote a proactive approach by addressing the psychological and cultural aspects of cybersecurity.

Why Connect Human Behavior with Cybersecurity?
To bridge the gap between human behavior and cybersecurity strategies.

To ensure proactive threat mitigation and promote a culture of digital safety.

To enhance security by addressing human factors that contribute to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Project Scope
Included:

Analysis of human error (phishing, weak passwords, policy violations)

Psychometric profiling using validated tools (HAIS-Q, CRPS)

Behavioral interventions: nudging, gamification, feedback systems

Cultural and leadership influence on cybersecurity behaviors

Development of scalable and modular analysis system using Python and Google Forms

Excluded:

Development of new technical security tools (e.g., antivirus)

Real-time behavioral tracking (due to system and privacy constraints)

Industry-specific case studies

Methodology
Incremental Software Development Model

Data Collection: Google Forms and Google Sheets

Psychometric Tools: HAIS-Q, CRPS

Behavioral Profiling: Using Python for statistical analysis and visualization

Customized Training: Based on user profiles like "Naïve Greenhorns" and "Reliable Troupers"

Deliverables
Custom-designed HAIS-Q and CRPS questionnaires

Dataset from ~200 participants

Python analysis scripts for behavioral profiling

Psychometric personas

Personalized training recommendations

Complete project documentation and system design

Results
Significant knowledge vs. behavior gap in cybersecurity practices.

Identified risk perception disconnect: Participants were aware of threats but underestimated personal vulnerability.

Trained users demonstrated 15% better security behaviors.

Psychometric profiling enabled personalized training recommendations.

Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, matplotlib, scipy)

Google Forms (data collection)

Google Sheets & Cloud Storage (data management)

SPSS (optional statistical validation)
